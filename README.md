## Saving the clutter in my brain

The goal of this repo is to keep an archive of the ideas / writings that have
influenced the way I think, or even just *made me think*.

Whenever I run into something that makes me think, save it under the
`/$year/$month/$day/$uri` directory. If it's a link, replicating the url as
best I can, if it's something else, such as a book, using the name of the book.

Inside the file save an excerpt and some thoughts on it, so that it can be found
later using simple tools like `grep` and `find`.
