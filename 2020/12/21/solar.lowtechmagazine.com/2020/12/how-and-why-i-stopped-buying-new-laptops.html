According to the most recent life cycle analysis, it takes 3,010 to 4,340
megajoules of primary energy to make a laptop – this includes mining the
materials, manufacturing the machine, and bringing it to market.

The other advantage is that I can work on any laptop that I want and that I’m
not dependent on a particular machine to access my work. You can get similar
advantages when you keep all your data in the cloud, but the SD-card is the more
sustainable option, and it works without internet access. 

Let’s make a complete cost calculation, including the investment in spare
laptops and SD-card, and using today’s prices for both solid-state drives and
SD-cards, which have become much cheaper since I have bought them:

    ThinkPad X60s: 50 euro
    ThinkPad X60s spare laptop: 60 euro
    ThinkPad X60 spare laptop: 75 euro
    Two replacement batteries: 50 euro
    240 GB solid-state drive: 30 euro
    128 GB SD-card: 20 euro
    Total: 285 euros

Even if you buy all of this, you only spent 285
euros. For that price, you may be able to buy the
crappiest new laptop on the market, but it surely
won’t get you two spare laptops. If you manage to
keep working with this lot for ten years, your
laptop costs would be 28.5 euros per year. You may
have to replace a few solid-state drives and
SD-cards, but it won’t make much difference.
Furthermore, you save the ecological damage that is
caused by the production of a new laptop every 5.7
years.
