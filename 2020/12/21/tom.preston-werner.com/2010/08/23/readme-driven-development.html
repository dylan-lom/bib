Write your Readme first.

Most importantly, you’re giving yourself a chance to think through the project
without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind
about how something should be organized or what should be included in the Public
API. Remember that feeling when you first started writing automated code tests
and realized that you caught all kinds of errors that would have otherwise snuck
into your codebase? That’s the exact same feeling you’ll have if you write the
Readme for your project before you write the actual code.
