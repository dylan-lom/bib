Continuing on in our series on exotic programming ideas, weâ€™re going to explore
the topic of effects. Weak forms of effect tagging are found in many mainstream
programming languages, however the use of programming with whole effect systems
that define syntax for defining and marking regions of effects in the surface
syntax is still an open area in language design.

There are no mainstream languages which use this model, however there is a
academic language out of Microsoft Research lab called Koka which presents the
most developed implementations of these ideas. As far as I can tell no one uses
this language for anything, however it is downloadable and quite usable to
explore these ideas. We will write all of our example code in Koka.
