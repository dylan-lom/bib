Small commitments
-----------------

Lately, I have been frustrated with some aspects of my life. COVID-19 did not
cause them, but helped bring them into sharp focus. As the least embarassing
example to admit in a public forum, I realized that while my book shelves are so
full of books that shoving another one requires my 80s-kids Tetris skills, I
have not read a single fiction book in the last three years. I used to be a
voracious reader!

How do you change habits? I used to read, easily, 200 pages of fiction a day in
my 20s. I have not gotten worse at reading. I could commit to reading 200 pages
a day, and track my progress. If you have ever done that, you know what the
outcome is. Every day, you look at the task, and you decide it is too big. You
never begin.

Instead, I decided I will read 20 pages a day, and feel good about it. Feel
good? I even decided to reward myself for every week where I hit this goal five
out seven days.

The result? The last few weeks, I have been consistently been reading 20 pages a
day, missing only one or two days.

The calendar
-----------

A minute has 60 seconds. An hour has 60 minutes. A day has 24 hours. Our time
measurement system is still based on the Babylonian base-60 system, though the
actual digits used by the Babylonians are studied only by specialists.

Humans organize their lives by their calendar. Kids learn that their birthday
happens when they are a year older. Every seven days, we have a weekend. Every
month, utility bills need to be paid.

Humans make plans that depend on time. They wait for their tax refund on April
15th to make purchases.

A time-based deprecation policy takes advantage of those skills. If the time
between deprecation and breakage is one week, then the policy is clear: better
make sure to upgrade weekly. If it is one year, do it when returning from the
end-of-year holidays. If the policy is incompatible with the expected value of
the maintenance effort, then this can be known in advance. This might mean that
that dependency is not mature enough to be used.
