Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence?

The water and energy use of the mist shower is so low that the bathroom could
be taken off-grid and off-pipe even in an urban context. 

The emissions of a typical shower equal 3.5 – 7 km of driving.

However, showering does not only wash the body. A shower that’s entirely focused
on cleaning the body – a so-called Navy shower or Sea shower– takes very little
time, energy and water. A Navy shower consists of a 30 seconds shower to get
wet, soaping the body while the water is off, and is completed by another 30
second shower to rinse the soapy water. 

The energy savings of a mist shower are smaller than its water savings

I found three nozzles – with a flow rate of roughly one liter of water per
minute – to be the minimum for providing the comfort of a hot shower. This would
bring the water use of a 8.9 minute mist shower down to 8.9 litres, which
corresponds with the water use of a one-minute Navy Shower. The energy use would
come down to 0.52 kWh, two to three times higher than that of a Navy shower.
This would provide four billion people with a wind-powered daily hot shower,
meaning that if we halved the shower duration (from 8.9 to 4.5 minutes) or
showered less frequently (once every two days), the global population could be
cleaned and pampered using only wind power.

Secondly, because of its high water use, a conventional shower needs to be
connected to the drain. The mist shower discharges much less water, which makes
it possible to take the shower off-pipe and treat the water on site, for example
to flush the toilet, water the plants, or clean the pavement. Third, a water
supply in the bathroom is not strictly necessary either: a small container could
be filled elsewhere and taken to the bathroom.
