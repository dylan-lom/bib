Another markup language
-----------------------
I quite like Markdown, but some things I would like to extend it with:

* A header section, e.g.
  > ---
  > title: Hello, World
  > date: 2020/12/28
  > tags: post, markup
  > ---

  + I don't think that the '---' is a good delimiter, maybe a `/** */`, JavaDoc
  style comment section.
* Inline shell/script execution
  > Compiled at: $(date) ($(whoami))

  + A possible feature (although this might be pushing it) is allowing
  snippets to be declared in the header section, so that you could script in
  other languages or just simplify repetitive calls in a portable way, e.g.
    > /**
    >  * sh-node: $(echo "$1" | node)
    >  */
    >
    > Compiled at $(sh-node 'new Date().toISOString()')

* Italics with /italics/. I think that org-mode does it this way and it makes
more sense to me, and differentiates from bold, which could be done with *bold*
now instead. I'd guess markdown doesn't use `/` because it's much more common in
text than `*`, so maybe this wouldn't be worthwhile.

* Linking with [display text[link]], again I think this is an org-mode ism, but
I really dislike [link](text), because it:
  + Seperates the link from the text
  + Emphasises the link over the text
  + Isn't intuitive as to which bracket/order should be used (at least to me)

Reviewing this list, I could probably just implement this as a pre-proccesor
type thing, making a flow like $(preprocess < input.smd | markdown >
output.html). I picked .smd for 'Shell MarkDown', which I think probably makes
sense, as the most significant change would be added the shell scripting.

It'd also be nice to extend something like VimWiki[1]'s ftplugin for markdown to
support the shell scripting (and other changes if they get made).
