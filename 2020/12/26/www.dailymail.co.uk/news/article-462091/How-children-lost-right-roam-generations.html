How children lost the right to roam in four generations
-------------------------------------------------------
The oldest member, George, was allowed to roam for six miles from home
unaccompanied when he was eight.

He was aged eight in 1950, and was allowed to walk for about one mile on his own
to the local woods. Again, he walked to school and never travelled by car. 

His son-in-law, Jack Hattersley, 63, was also given freedom to roam.

He was aged eight in 1950, and was allowed to walk for about one mile on his own
to the local woods. Again, he walked to school and never travelled by car.

"I was able to go out quite freely - I'd ride my bike around the estate, play
with friends in the park and walk to the swimming pool and to school," said Mrs
Grant, 36. 

Stress levels fall within minutes of seeing green spaces, he says. Even filling
a home with flowers and plants can improve concentration and lower stress.

"If children haven't had contact with nature, they never develop a relationship
with natural environment and they are unable to use it to cope with stress," he
said.

"Studies have shown that people deprived of contact with nature were at greater
risk of depression and anxiety. Children are getting less and less unsupervised
time in the natural environment.
