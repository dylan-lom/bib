Scientists are teaching robots to avoid children -- because some kids are
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
surprisingly evil
-----------------

The scientists dropped off a polite robot in a Japanese shopping mall, fully
anticipating random violence. Sure enough gangs of thug children beat the bolts
out of their mechanised friend.

in certain situations, children are actually horrible little brats may not be as
empathetic towards robots as we’d previously thought, with gangs of unsupervised
tykes repeatedly punching, kicking, and shaking a robot in a Japanese mall.

The researchers learned two things almost always preceded a violent attack: 1)
kids persistently blocking the bot’s path and 2) verbal abuse.

But it’s more than a bit unnerving when nearly three-quarters of the 28 kids
interviewed “perceived the robot as human-like,” yet decided to abuse it anyway.
That and 35% of the kids who beat up the robot actually did so “for enjoyment.”

From this finding, we speculate that, although one might consider that
human-likeness might help moderating the abuse, humanlikeness is probably not
that powerful way to moderate robot abuse. […] [W]e face a question: whether the
increase of human-likeness in a robot simply leads to the increase of children’s
empathy for it, or favours its abuse from children with a lack of empathy for it.
