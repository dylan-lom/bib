Single Player Offline - The Lonely Ritual of Disconnected Console Gaming
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course the somber, isolated tone of the game probably added to the effect,
but I was struck by how much more 'alone' I felt when I knew that it was just me
and the game; no achievements, no friends lists, no updates or DLC, no popup
notifications. Just a fairly obscure (and little celebrated, as far as I know)
game from the now-far-off year of 2004, crystallized in time.

I called it The Emulator Problem. Suddenly I had every NES game in the world at
my disposal, something that would have melted my brain back in 1989. If I got
frustrated with one or I wanted to try something else, a new game was an ESC
keypress and a couple mouse clicks away. I'll be honest, it kind of ruined NES
games for me for a long time. My attention span and tolerance for frustration
went straight into the dumpster and I just couldn't appreciate them anymore. It
wasn't until I started doing it the old way that the magic came back for me.

In conclusion: if you're a retro games fan and you've been playing mostly on PS4
and Switch lately, why not dig out your old SNES or PS1 and re-commit to the
ritual? Pop in Resident Evil 2 or relive some old RPG glory of your childhood.
If you really wanna feel old, see what's on those ancient memory cards in your
drawer and what the timestamp on your file is :^0
