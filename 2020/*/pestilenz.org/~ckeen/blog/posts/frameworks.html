I keep recommending one "unpublished" book by Chuck Moore to my friends:
Programming A Problem-Oriented-Language. As most good stuff around computers and
their operation it is from the 70ies and not everyone shares my enthusiasm about
it. It describes the ideas Mr. Moore had (or has) about Forth's Gestalt as means
to describe programmer's intentions in a more natural and terse way.

Keep it Simple
--------------

Do not speculate
----------------
This is also still part of the agreed on best practices when designing software.
Write for current needs, don't implement features in anticipation of a future
use case that most likely will never happen, at least in the imagined form.
Especially the pointy haired bosses understand this as a precaution not to waste
the company's money. Still the code bases grow beyond repair and understanding.
I think this is related to the last corollary of Mr. Moore's basic principle,
which I haven't found anywhere else so far:

Do it yourself
--------------
So frameworks tend to mutate into a melting pot of different ideas by programmer
fighting different problems and with different needs and models of their problem
domain.
