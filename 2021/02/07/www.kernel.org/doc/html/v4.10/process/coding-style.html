Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible chunks, unless
exceeding 80 columns significantly increases readability and does not hide
information. Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and
are placed substantially to the right. The same applies to function headers with
a long argument list. However, never break user-visible strings such as printk
messages, because that breaks the ability to grep for them.

Rationale: K&R.

Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing. They should fit on
one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size is 80x24, as we all
know), and do one thing and do that well.

The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the complexity and
indentation level of that function. So, if you have a conceptually simple
function that is just one long (but simple) case-statement, where you have to do
lots of small things for a lot of different cases, it’s OK to have a longer
function.

However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a less-than-gifted
first-year high-school student might not even understand what the function is
all about, you should adhere to the maximum limits all the more closely. Use
helper functions with descriptive names (you can ask the compiler to in-line
them if you think it’s performance-critical, and it will probably do a better
job of it than you would have done).

Another measure of the function is the number of local variables. They shouldn’t
exceed 5-10, or you’re doing something wrong. Re-think the function, and split
it into smaller pieces. A human brain can generally easily keep track of about 7
different things, anything more and it gets confused. You know you’re brilliant,
but maybe you’d like to understand what you did 2 weeks from now.

Albeit deprecated by some people, the equivalent of the goto statement is used
frequently by compilers in form of the unconditional jump instruction.

The goto statement comes in handy when a function exits from multiple locations
and some common work such as cleanup has to be done. If there is no cleanup
needed then just return directly.

Choose label names which say what the goto does or why the goto exists. An
example of a good name could be out_free_buffer: if the goto frees buffer. Avoid
using GW-BASIC names like err1: and err2:, as you would have to renumber them if
you ever add or remove exit paths, and they make correctness difficult to verify
anyway.

The rationale for using gotos is:

    * unconditional statements are easier to understand and follow
    * nesting is reduced
    * errors by not updating individual exit points when making
      modifications are prevented
    * saves the compiler work to optimize redundant code away ;)

CAPITALIZED macro names are appreciated but macros resembling functions may be
named in lower case.* 

    If the name of a function is an action or an imperative command,
    the function should return an error-code integer.  If the name
    is a predicate, the function should return a "succeeded" boolean.
